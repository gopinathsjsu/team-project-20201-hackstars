## üí° Design Decisions

- **Authentication & Security**  
  - **JWT** for stateless, role-based access control (Customer, Manager, Admin)  
  - **bcrypt** for password hashing  
  - HTTPS, CORS policies, and rate limiting on sensitive routes   

- **External Integrations**  
  - **Google Maps Places API** for geolocation & map embeds  
  - **AWS S3** for storing and serving restaurant photos  
  - **Nodemailer** for booking confirmation emails/SMS  

- **Deployment**  
  - **Frontend**: React.js single‚Äêpage app, hosted on AWS S3 & CloudFront  
  - **Backend**: Node.js + Express APIs running on an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances  
  - **Database**: MongoDB Atlas cluster  
  - **File Storage**: AWS S3 for restaurant image uploads   

- **User Experience**  
  - Mobile-first, responsive layouts  
  - Streamlined booking flow (search ‚Üí select time slot ‚Üí confirm)  
  - Real-time availability checks to avoid double-bookings
  
- **Design Patterns**
  - **MVC**: Separation of Controllers (Express routes), Services (business logic) and Models (Mongoose schemas)  
  - **Singleton**: Single shared MongoDB connection instance across modules  
  - **Factory**: Service factories to instantiate Mongoose models and helpers
